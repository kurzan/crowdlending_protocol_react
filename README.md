## Overview and roadmap

Early Bird is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Binance Smart Chain Testnet that blurs the boundaries between companies and investors, each user of the platform can invest in a company located anywhere in the world. In turn, companies can raise financing for their projects more efficiently due to the absence of long chains of intermediaries in obtaining loans and due to the wide range of coverage around the world.

1. Benefits for borrowers - reducing the chains of intermediaries to a minimum when obtaining a loan, which makes the cost of a loan more attractive to companies.

2. Advantages for investors - investing in a business without excluding a person, which is relevant in our time, when the authorities prohibit investing in the assets of certain countries. Higher interest rates than in traditional finance cases by reducing the cost to companies in obtaining a loan.

3. In order for a company on the platform to receive the status of a verified company, it must undergo a thorough solvency check on our part. Otherwise, the company will receive the status of a high-risk company and an unverified label.

Disadvantages of the company - Not all companies participate in funds in this way, as this is supported by the laws of the countries in which they are registered.

Investor Disadvantages. Even though there is always a risk of default during a thorough due diligence. Investors should carefully consider which company to invest in after examining their financial condition.
